# Minesweeper

A very basic implementation of a 10x10 minesweeper game using Numpy and Pygame. The whole purpose of making this is to practice using the 2D arrays of Numpy and graphics generation and user interaction capabilities of the Pygame library.

Current Features:
- changeable number of bombs
- changeable number of hints
- changeable number of initially uncovered tiles

Missing Features:
- changeable game board size (the current size is 10x10 board)
- game scoring strategy
- more elaborate scheme for initially uncovered tiles
- more elaborate scheme to uncover more than one tile at each click
- hidden treasures/coins for added points (like the treasure hunt game)
